We have deployed this app from source and as a module so that developers can get their hands on it.

However, we also recognise that most NHS and healthcare institions internationally do not have time for this and just want to deploy on prem / in the cloud to test the API.

For this reason we have deployed Peteredactyl as both source, a module and as a Gradio web-app with API. We picked Gradio because it interfaces really well with Huggingface, is lightweight and is much easier to maintain.
